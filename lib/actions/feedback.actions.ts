CRITICAL SCORING INSTRUCTIONS - FOLLOW EXACTLY:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

YOU MUST BE HARSH AND REALISTIC. This is not a participation trophy.

COMMUNICATION SKILLS SCORING:

- 86-95: Excellent communication, well-structured, detailed, professional, engaging
- 96-100: Outstanding, exceptional clarity, perfect structure, compelling storytelling

TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE SCORING:
- 0-20: Wrong answers, no understanding, made up information
- 21-35: Minimal knowledge, major gaps, surface-level only
- 36-50: Basic understanding but significant gaps, needs much more study
- 51-65: Adequate knowledge for junior level, some gaps remain
- 66-75: Solid understanding, minor gaps, good for mid-level
- 76-85: Strong knowledge, detailed understanding, senior level
- 86-95: Expert level, deep understanding, teaches others
- 96-100: Exceptional mastery, industry thought leader level

PROBLEM SOLVING SCORING:
- 0-20: Cannot solve basic problems, no logical approach
- 21-35: Attempts but fails, illogical approach, gives up easily
- 36-50: Solves simple problems with heavy guidance, struggles with complexity
- 51-65: Solves problems but needs hints, approach is basic
- 66-75: Independent problem solving, decent approach, some optimization
- 76-85: Strong problem solver, considers edge cases, good optimization
- 86-95: Excellent problem solver, multiple approaches, optimal solutions
- 96-100: Exceptional, innovative solutions, considers trade-offs masterfully

BEHAVIORAL/SITUATIONAL SCORING:
- 0-20: No examples, vague responses, cannot articulate experiences
- 21-35: Vague examples, no STAR method, lacks detail
- 36-50: Some examples but poorly structured, missing key details
- 51-65: Basic examples with some structure, could be more specific
- 66-75: Good examples, uses STAR method, clear outcomes
- 76-85: Strong examples, detailed STAR, quantified results
- 86-95: Excellent examples, compelling stories, leadership shown
- 96-100: Outstanding examples, exceptional impact, inspirational

MANDATORY PENALTIES (APPLY THESE):
- If avg words/answer < 20: MAX score 35 across all categories
- If avg words/answer < 30: MAX score 45 across all categories  
- If avg words/answer < 40: MAX score 55 in communication
- If empty answers > 2: Deduct 10 points from total score
- If completion rate < 50%: MAX total score 40
- If completion rate < 70%: MAX total score 55
- If interview was rushed: Deduct 5 points from total
- If answers lack examples: MAX 60 in behavioral
- If no technical specifics: MAX 50 in technical
- If one-word answers exist: MAX 30 in communication

REALITY CHECK:
- Average candidate scores: 55-70
- Good candidate scores: 70-80  
- Strong candidate scores: 80-90
- Exceptional candidate scores: 90-95
- Perfect scores (96-100): Extremely rare, maybe 1 in 1000 interviews

Based on the metrics:
- Avg ${summary.avgWordsPerAnswer.toFixed(0)} words/answer ${summary.avgWordsPerAnswer < 40 ? "= RED FLAG 🚩" : summary.avgWordsPerAnswer < 60 ? "= NEEDS WORK ⚠️" : "= GOOD ✓"}
- ${summary.emptyAnswers} empty answers ${summary.emptyAnswers > 0 ? "= MAJOR ISSUE 🚩" : "= GOOD ✓"}
- ${summary.completionRate.toFixed(0)}% completion ${summary.completionRate < 70 ? "= POOR 🚩" : summary.completionRate < 85 ? "= FAIR ⚠️" : "= GOOD ✓"}

YOUR TASK:
1. Analyze each answer critically against the question asked
2. Identify specific failures, gaps, and weaknesses
3. Give credit ONLY where truly deserved
4. Provide actionable, specific feedback
5. Don't soften the truth - candidates need reality to improve
